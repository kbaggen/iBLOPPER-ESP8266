# iBLOPPER-ESP8266

What is the iBLOPPER?
iBLOPPER is a Bubble Logger or more precise an activity fermentation logger and temperature controller to be attached to your (S)airlock. It detects the release of a bubble, reporting, Blops pr. min (BPM), indicative SG estimate and temperature into iBLOPPER CLOUD.

We support two different versions of iBLOPPER either detection by vibration/gyroscope sensor (iBLOPPERV) or by using a sound sensor (iBLOPPERS). By 2023 we promote the sound version as best suited for (s)airlocks and most users. A

Secondly, the iBLOPPER can trigger a set of Wifi Smart Plug from Shelly or Tasmota over your local internet by http commands and hence you can control your frezzer/heating agent from iBLOPPER CLOUD.

To use the “iBLOPPER” just attach the iBLOPPER to your airlock, then enter your brew details at iBLOPPER CLOUD. During the brew at preferably after high kreutzen you will need to take one hydrometer reading and by very simple math you will be able to predict the final gravity by a few units. All while you monitor from the outside of the fermenter.

iBLOPPER CLOUD
iBLOPPER CLOUD CONNECTED. The Logger is completely autonomous, hence, only need wifi credentials set once and else all handling/controlling is entirely done at the iBLOPPER CLOUD page. Hence, please register with your 7-8 cipher unique iBLOPPER Number at iBLOPPER CLOUD.

At the CLOUD you can set brew name, size, OG and polynomial for speed of fermentation. You can ofcouse start, stop and delete logged brews.

You can change setting for Fahrenheit, set time zone and forward the current Active Brew till BrewSpy, Brewfather, Ubidots or Brewersfriend if you wish. A RESTfull API is also provided for attaching data till other services.

iBLOPPER CLOUD is a crude installment for a CLOUD service, but continuedly work is planned.
